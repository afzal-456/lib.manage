# lib.manage
This C program implements a basic Library Management System tailored for a Computer Science Department. It allows users to manage a collection of books, issue books to students, and handle book returns. The program is designed to run in a command-line interface and provides a user-friendly menu for easy interaction.
Key Features:

Struct Definitions:

Defines two main structs, struct Book and struct Student, to represent books and students, respectively.
Book and Student Management Functions:

addBook: Allows the user to add a new book to the library by entering details such as ID, title, author, and quantity.
displayBooks: Displays the list of available books in a tabular format, including details like ID, title, author, and quantity.
issueBook: Facilitates the issuance of a book to a student, updating the book quantity and maintaining student records.
returnBook: Manages the return of a book, updating the book quantity and removing the book from the student's record.
Initialization of Books:

Initializes the library with some initial books using the initialBooks array, providing a starting point for the library inventory.
Menu-Driven Interface:

Implements a user-friendly menu in the main loop, enabling users to choose various options such as adding books, displaying the library inventory, issuing books, returning books, or exiting the program.
Dynamic Updates:

The program dynamically updates the book inventory and student records based on user actions, ensuring accurate and real-time information.
GitHub Integration:

Suitable for GitHub repositories, this code is well-commented, modular, and easily understandable. It serves as a foundational example for those looking to build a simple library management system in C.
